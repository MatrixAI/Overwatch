## [Systemtap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki)

Systemtap might be more likely to break application than BCC.

## [Summary of Tracing Systems](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/07/05/linux-tracing-systems/)

There's a file system interface, `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/`. It's called ftrace (filesystem trace?).

The author seems to think BPF/BCC is the easiest and most powerful option.

## [Riemann](https://kartar.net/2014/12/an-introduction-to-riemann/)

Riemann runs on JVM and is written in Clojure. It probably doesn't handle network partitions, it seems centralised.

## [Collectd](https://collectd.org/index.shtml)

Collectd seems simple and able to do everything Roger wanted to start with, including output to RRD.

## Thoughts

What if a sysadmin wants to add a program to Matrix and use information from the logs for monitoring. This must be specified, not only by the location of the log file, but there must be some form of pattern matching to get the information into Overwatch.

Matrix will have to collect logs.
