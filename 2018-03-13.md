## [Problog Paper](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/392821/3/plp2cnf.pdf)

Other Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) languages are mentioned, including ICL (Poole, 2008), PRISM (Sato and Kameya, 2008) and LPAD/CP-logic (Vennekens et al. 2009).

Note that a "a state-of-the-art solver for ... MAX-SAT" will either be incredibly slow or not actually solve the max-sat problem, since max-sat is NP-Hard.

The paper seems to go into a lot of detail, but atleast makes clear that the other paper (see [11/3](./2018-03-11.md)) was wrong.

## [PRISM Paper (2011)](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/papers/cav11.pdf)

PRISM seems to support different probabalistic models for different applications.

PTAs seem a good way of modelling a piece of software or hardware, but I'm not sure that is relevant to Matrix.

PRISM has builtin verification systems to determine probabilities for certain events, or to determine the expected reward a system receives. These might be useful to Matrix.
