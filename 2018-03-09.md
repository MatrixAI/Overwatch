## [Elm Paper](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/archived/Czaplicki.pdf) continued

This has a really nice summary of the history of FRP.

There are no actually continuous streams from user input, and having continuous streams uses excessive computing power.

Access to the current time in Elm requires the programmer specify how often it is updated.

foldp means "fold from past", similar to how foldl and foldr mean "fold from left" and "fold from right" respectively. The way foldp is described in Elm indicates that their streams are all discrete, and programmers can query their most-recent value, or fold each individual value together.

### Relevance to Architect

The only kind of streams Architect is actually concerned with is network connections. There are many different ways of abstracting this.

For reactive services, an automaton is a function that turns requests into responses (`Stream Request -> Stream Response`), but may generate more requests too (`[Stream Request -> Stream Response] -> Stream Request -> Stream Response`).

For simplicity, `data Service = Stream Request -> Stream Response`. In specifying a particular automaton, it could have types like `Service`, `Service -> Service`, or a longer string depending on the number of other services it has to interact with. The arguments taken could be specific automatons, or just general required services.

This allows for combinators, which would have types like `[Service] -> Service`, and distribute load between the given services in some way. To allow for proper load balancing combinators, there may be need for some reporting channel for services, perhaps along the lines of `data Service = Stream Request -> (Stream Response, Overwatch)`.

Actually, Architect doesn't need to allow programmers to implement combinators. Instead, they can simply state the constraints and Overwatch/Emergence can figure out the combinators for them.

Architect will not have any notion of `lift`, `fold`, etc. It will work purely with automatons. For that reason, it might be worth looking into the specifics of arrowised FRPs, as they may be the closest parallel.

It's also worth thinking about how other types of services would be implemented, like computation and storage tasks.

## [Arrowised FRP](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/workshop-02.pdf)

An AFRP (Arrowised FRP) only gives the programmer access to the `SF` type, `SF a b = Signal a -> Signal b`, and not the actual signals.
