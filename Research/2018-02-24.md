## Thoughts

If overwatch is distributed, we have to consider PACELC.

## [Choosing a Linux Tracer](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2015-07-08/choosing-a-linux-tracer.html)

From [the linked slides](https://www.slideshare.net/brendangregg/velocity-2015-linux-perf-tools)

## [Latency Heat Maps](http://www.brendangregg.com/HeatMaps/latency.html)

Heat maps are a good way to visualise latency over time, as it reveals patterns more clearly. Could be useful for UI. Heat maps also cut down on the storage cost for this information: no matter how many events are monitored, unit of time takes a fixed number of pixels in the heatmap.

The author recommends using eBPF to reduce overhead when making heatmaps.

## [Tracing a packet journey](https://blog.yadutaf.fr/2017/07/28/tracing-a-packet-journey-using-linux-tracepoints-perf-ebpf/)

eBPF can be used to run platform independent code in the live kernel. [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) is a tool for writing BPF programs. More reading might be useful at a later date.

## World of Events Paper - Notes

a < b means a is before b, and a || b means neither a < b, b < a nor a = b. Basically, exactly one of the following is true: a < b, a > b, a = b, a || b. Extending this, one of the following is true: a <> b, a = b, a || b.

W |= a < b or W |= a || b just means that the expression is true in W. |=\* generalises this to include <>. The distinction exists since W |= a r b is true for one relation for every a != b, while W |=\* a r b is true for one or two relations for a != b. < and || are accurate, <> is inaccurate.

< is transitive.

A microcosm is a finite (since cardinality is less than aleph null) subset of events with a strict ordering (I), ie no events in I are ||, and a finite subset of relations that are true (E), and where the two events in the relation are not endpoints of some chain of <, including < that are in I or E. However, a < b cannot be in E, as that implies a < b is not in E, so the only case where a relation could not be in E would be if it involves two things in I (of the form a<>b) or if it is of the form a<b.

This paper is very annoying, will revisit in future.

## [Reliability and Availability](http://www.eventhelix.com/RealtimeMantra/FaultHandling/reliability_availability_basics.htm)

Hardware failures can be categorised into those caused by manufacturing faults, which occur earlier, those caused by wear and tear, which occur later, and random or design flaws, which can occur any time.

If software in a system fails, the system should restart that software. Overwatch must be able to detect software failure, otherwise someone must manually restart the software, which could take hours or weeks. There are multiple ways a system could recover from software failure, including reloading from a saved state, restarting the task, rebooting the OS and using stored data or rebooting the OS and downloading data.

If we know or estimate a system's time between failures and time to recover from failures, we get its availability. A 3-nines availability means the system is not broken 99.9% of the time, k-nines means the system is not broken 1-10^(-k) of the time. We can also measure this as downtime: a 1-nine system is down 36.5 days each year, and a 6-nines system is down 31 seconds each year.

### Relevance

It may be useful for overwatch to more closely monitor new systems to detect manufacturing faults, and to notice increases in faults on a system and possibly attribute them to wear and tear.

Overwatch must be able to detect the failure of software so action can be taken, such as restarting the software or the entire OS, since human intervention could take weeks.

## [System Reliability and Availability](http://www.eventhelix.com/RealtimeMantra/FaultHandling/system_reliability_availability.htm)

If we compose two pieces of software, we multiply their availability to get the availability of the whole. If we have multiple instances of software running in parallel, we multiply their downtime.

### Relevance

If overwatch needs 3-nines availability of software A, and running software A on node X obtains 2-nines availability, and running software A on node Y obtains 1-nine availability, then we can run software A on both systems in parallel to get 3-nines availability. So, if availability is a QoS constraint, overwatch can estimate the availability of everything and predict ways of obtaining the required availability.

However, floating point notation is best suited to numbers close to 0 rather than 1. The solution is to use downtime as the metric (atleast internally). So, instead of taking the downtime of two systems (Dx and Dy), and calculating the downtime of their composition using availability (D = 1-(1-Dx)(1-Dy)), we do the simpler calculation D=Dx+Dy-DxDy, which avoids issues with floating point, as we only ever calculate and store numbers close to 0.

Thus, to use downtime as a metric, we need only keep in mind that for two systems with downtimes Dx and Dy, running them in parallel has downtime DxDy, and composing them has downtime Dx+Dy-DxDy.

Composing is abstract, and applies whenever the two systems rely on each-other. They could be a piece of hardware running a piece of software, or any two systems running together.

### For next time

I was up to the section on Partial Operation Availability
