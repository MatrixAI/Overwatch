## [Quantile Estimation](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~muthu/bquant.pdf)

[This](https://github.com/postmates/quantiles) might be a good implementation. If not, we could implement it ourselves.

The algorithm is extremely efficient at determining specific quantiles with specific error bounds. After some research I found nothing more efficient.
