## Binding [Quantile Implementation in Rust](https://github.com/postmates/quantiles/)

### Haskell

Based on [this example](https://github.com/aisamanra/rust-haskell-ffi), making a Haskell binding looks easy.

[This](https://github.com/mgattozzi/curryrs) might be worth a look too.

### Python

[Maybe look at this](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rustypy/0.1.15)

## Thought

If I bind quantile estimation to haskell, then I need the monitoring data from bcc in Haskell. A unix pipe will probably suffice for this. But then I want database tools from Haskell. Research into versatile databases is probably most important here.

Should we keep all monitoring data for some time period before aggregating it in a database?
