## [cadvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)

There is a lot of data presented, but the way it's shown to the user is limited: it summarises the data but offers no customisation, and any flaws in its data presentation (axis not starting from 0, bad sampling rate) might not be configurable.

This tool will not be useful in the devlopment of matrix, but might be useful for quickly diagnosing the behaviour of containers, unless we find something better.

I cannot figure out from the source code where the data comes from. If we knew this we might learn something.

There is an API, however it does not appear to expose the vast majority of the collected statistics; it is basically useless.

## [Canopy](https://cs.brown.edu/~jcmace/papers/kaldor2017canopy.pdf)

This paper appears to address many of the issues Matrix is facing.

It seems tracing the requests caused by one request is common practice. It might be useful for matrix to notice when requests to an automaton that come from different automatons take different amounts of time, so we should keep details of latency within the network.

They appear to be using perf to get trace data.

## [WeaveWorks - Scope](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope)

This is much more interesting than cadvisor, it needs more exploration.

## Thoughts

How will a migration event be triggered? Will it be a single cluster deciding an automaton should be moved/duplicated, or do we need a concensus algorithm to decide that.
