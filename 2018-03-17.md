## [WeaveWorks - Scope](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope) continued

This tool shows more details about container connectivity than cadvisor, but still lacks information about network traffic. It does seem to show cpu and memory use, but without any history, so cadvisor wins there.

## [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

This is for visualising montioring data. It looks very good, and it might be worth making a plugin for visualising Overwatch data. Depends how that works economically.

## [Tracing Network Packets with BCC](https://blog.yadutaf.fr/2017/07/28/tracing-a-packet-journey-using-linux-tracepoints-perf-ebpf/)

This shows the power of BCC. It can do lots. It will be worth reading this to get an idea how to do stuff in BCC if we have to.

Couldn't get BCC working, might need a newer OS.

## OpenTracing

To use OpenTracing requires modification of the server code. This is not suitable for matrix, as we want to monitor containers.
