## [Linear Temporal Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic)

Adding to predicate logic, Modal logic has symbols for "necessary that" and "possible that".

Makes sure instances satisfy hard constraints and maximise objective functions.

A Constraint Optimisation Problem (COP) is a set of variables, domains of those variables, constraints and objectives. A constraint is a function of the domains that yields a boolean. An objective is a function of the domains that yields a positive real (bigger = better).

A Distributed COP (DCOP) adds a set of agents, each of which controls a disjoint subset of variables. A constraint or objective is local to an agent if that agent controls all the variables involved.

"DCOPs are designed for situations where ... it is not practical to combine all the knowledge in one place."

A Dynamic DCOP (DynDCOP) is a sequence of DCOPs where each problem has atleast one variable unchanged from the previous problem. A solution to a DybDCOP is a series of solutions to each DCOP.

The neighbourhood graph of a DCOP is a graph whose vertices are agents, and whose edges are agents that control variables that contribute to the same objective or constraint.

An assignment of a DCOP is an agent, a set of variable-value pairs, and the utility of that assignment with respect to the agent's local objectives.

An evaluation of a DCOP is an objective, a value for each variable in that objective, and the value of that objective given those values.

A proposal of a DCOP is a series of assignments, whose agents form a simple path through the neighbourhood, and a set of evaluations.

A nogood of a DCOP is a set of variable-value pairs and a set of constraints such that the assignment fails atleast one constraint. A minimal nogood is one where no subset of either set combined with the entire other set would form a nogood.

The total utility of a proposal is the sum of the utilities of all of its assignments and evaluations.

The ordering over proposals is lexicographic, considering
1. Highest total utility
1. Highest number of assignments
1. Some consistent random function of proposals (eg. hash)

Each agent stores
* The agent that its current proposal is based off
* Its current proposal
* The most recently received proposal from each agent
* All nogoods received (and their senders)
* The most recent proposal sent to each agent
* The multiset of nogoods sent (and their recepients)
* A subset of objectives that includes atleast all the ones that its variables effect
* A subset of constraints that includes atleast all the ones that its variables effect

Agents can send proposals and nogoods to each other. Agents can tell other agents to remove nogoods. The environment can tell agents to add or remove constraints or objectives, and must include the details of any agents the recepient might be unaware of. Agents can ask other agents to resend their most recent proposal.

Messages are processed by agents in the following order
1. Changes to nogoods
1. Changes to constraints and objectives
1. New proposals
1. Requests to resend proposals

## Thoughts

Emergence can, at the top-most level treat data centers as single resource pools, and simply assign loads to data centers. Then, each data center can handle internal scheduling seperately. This reduces the effects of partitions, and allows us to use different algorithms at the different levels.
