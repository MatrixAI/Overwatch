## [ProbLog](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/146072/1/ijca)

This could be very useful to Matrix in trying to satisfy reliability and latency constraints.

### Thoughts

Maybe Architect should be like Prolog. To decide if Architect should be like Prolog, someone on the team would have to know Prolog to decide how well all the other possible features could be integrated, but the work from ProbLog would be more easily adapted. If Architect were more like Haskell, the FRP stuff could be easily integrated and the entire language would be more quickly developed, though implementing probability stuff might be harder.

Maybe Prolog-style syntax could be added to Haskell, maybe enclosed in a Monad. Prolog might do well with some stronger types.

In Prolog, `a -> b ; c` means `if a then b else c`, though it is sometimes frowned upon.

~~This language treats a clause like `0.5: p(X) :- q(X)` as a universal probability for `p`, so given `1: q(X) :- true`, the probability of `p(a), p(b)` is 0.5, not 0.25.~~
**No**, if you check the actual implementation on a query like the one described above, it gives it probability 0.25, and even running the `problog sample` command yields probability 0.25. The paper is incorrect.

This is essentially because of two interpretations of the expression `0.5: p(X) :- q(X)`:
* &forall;a P(q(a)&rarr;p(a)) = 0.5, which is intuitive and the implementation of ProbLog uses
* P(&forall;a q(a)&rarr;p(a)) = 0.5, which the paper uses

Checking the actual probability of a query is NP-Hard.

Should read the [full article](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/392821/3/plp2cnf.pdf) to get an idea of how it actually works.
