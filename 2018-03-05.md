## Mu Calculus Continued

Essentially, νZ.x is the largest set T where x[Z/T] holds in all of T, and μZ.x is the smallest set T where x[Z/T] is contained in T.

## [LTL and Functional Reactive Programming](https://www.slideshare.net/SergeiWinitzki/temporal-logic-and-functional-reactive-programming)

The talk uses U instead of W and U' instead of U. It uses N instead of X.

The talk defines U and U' in terms of mu calculus, but N could also be defined like that (using states and the like).

The talk brings up an equivalent to DNF for LTL, though shows it is hard to find, store, or work with one.

We can use N, F, G and U to define types. A type of N x means x will be available next tick, F x means x will be available eventually, G x means an infinite stream of x (changing each tick), xUy means a stream of x that may end with a y. This requires that implication represent functions, disjunction represent Either, and conjunction represent a tuple.

μ^Z.x means μZ.x[Z/NZ]

The talk has some recommendations for a LTL FRP language.

This blew my mind and I really hope it is useful to Matrix.

## [High Order Functional Reactive Programming](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~neelk/simple-frp.pdf)

The paper mentions an alternative to FRP: Synchronous Dataflow Languages. These sound a lot more relevant to Matrix and are worth looking into.

N x is defined as something that will evaluate to something of type x next time step. G x is defined as a value of type x that never changes. Instead, μ^Z.x can be used to define streams, or the builtin stream type.

This has a really nice summary of the history of FRP.

## Thoughts

A type like G (G x) could actually be useful, say if we always have incoming streams that could be different.

A FRP would be really hard to implement if there is continuous time.

A function like getLine could have F String, so F must be interpreted with an "unless the program shuts down uncontrollably". Lots of things that would normally be considered having a type IO might now be considered having type F or G, though how do we deal with two threads accessing the same resource?

Something of type F x must keep its containing value stored, otherwise it is possible to keep it long enough that the value is gone. The best approach is probably to have it represent only one value and never change, since other behaviours could be represented in other ways (such as keeping the most recent value is F (G x), keeping a list of all values is F (G [x])).

I can think of two ways to implement G. It could either be strictly continuous, basically mapping infinitely small moments to values, thus making it impossible to enumerate its values and easy to miss its changes. The other method is to make it like a list of timestamp value pairs.

" The type system should treat it as continuous, but the implementation should treat it as discrete"

A discrete stream could be defined, without G, as DS x = F (x, DS x), or maybe [F x].

It is probably useful to have both continuous streams and discrete streams.
