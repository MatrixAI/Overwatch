## Monitoring

Based on measurements by `perf`:

| # LANChat clients | network syscalls / second |
| -: | -: |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 12 |
| 5 | 20 |

Looking at the timing of system calls, it is easy to tell the number of peers a LANchat instance has. I hope to see this graphically.

Similar to how `syscalls:sys_enter_connect` matches system calls to connect over network, `syscalls:sys_enter_accept` matches system calls to accept network connections.

We can add calls to probe, such as `perf probe --add tcp_sendmsg`, which allows us to then `perf record -e probe:tcp_sendmsg -a sleep 10` and see when tcp packets are sent.

## Tools

perf is very powerful.

iptraf, tcpdump, nicstat, netstat, ethtool, hping3 don't seem that useful.

## [BPF / BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)

Just with the examples, I can see LANchat accepting connections over bpf, where I could not do so with perf.

The code for the examples is a mix of python and C. It seems fairly easy to read, so writing BCC programs for Matrix might be feasable.
