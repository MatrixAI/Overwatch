## Monitoring

Based on measurements by `perf`:

| # LANChat clients | network syscalls / second |
| -: | -: |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 12 |
| 5 | 20 |

Looking at the timing of system calls, it is easy to tell the number of peers a LANchat instance has. I hope to see this graphically.

Similar to how `syscalls:sys_enter_connect` matches system calls to connect over network, `syscalls:sys_enter_accept` matches system calls to accept network connections.

We can add calls to probe, such as `perf probe --add tcp_sendmsg` allows us to then `perf record -e probe:tcp_sendmsg -a sleep 10` and see when tcp packets are sent.
